# 🛠 BeanCounter – SMT Parts Counting Tool (Forked)

This is a **fork of the original BeanCounter project** by Nick Poole. The **BeanCounter** is a compact SMT parts counting tool designed to accurately track electronic components in carrier tapes. It is powered by an **ATtiny861V-10MU microcontroller** and features an **IR sensor-based counting system** with a **7-segment display**.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Counts SMT parts in carrier tapes efficiently  
✅ Supports **Inventory Mode** (fast, no direction tracking) and **Dispense Mode** (precise, directional counting)  
✅ **7-segment LED display** for real-time count tracking  
✅ **EEPROM storage** for user settings (tape pitch, mode selection)  
✅ **Self-test function** for IR sensor diagnostics  
✅ Optimized firmware written in **Arduino (C++)** using **Spence Konde's ATTinyCore**

## 🔧 Enhancements in This Fork
🚀 Improved firmware with optimized **state management**  
🚀 Fixed pin definitions and **hardware configurations**  
🚀 Enhanced **timer settings and IR sensor handling**  
🚀 Refined **power efficiency and EEPROM usage**
